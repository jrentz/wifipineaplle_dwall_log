This was pulled form a slightly modified version of DWall v 1.2  It was to provide local logging.  I have not updated things yet, however, it works as is on pineapple v 2.5.4.  Once installed, be sure not to upgrade to DWall v 1.3 as that seems to break everything.  Also, DWall, as well as several other modules, seems to only work if connected via USB.  Just FYI
